The primary focus of the Climate & Earth Surface Geochemistry Group at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UCSD is to understand and reconstruct the geochemical evolution of Earthâ€™s surface.

We apply radiogenic and non-traditional stable isotope geochemistry to gain new insight into processes that shape this evolution. Below are some of the examples of projects we are currently funded to work on.
