The Indigenous Futures Institute (IFI) at UC San Diego is an interdisciplinary community-engaged and -driven research center focused on educational, scientific, and environmental co-design with Indigenous Peoples. 

The IFI creates projects concerned, principally, with the transformative power of the future. As an Indigenous-led, futurist design university organization, IFI is the first and only institute of its kind in the country.
