Plastic Futures' is a multi-part installation that emerges at the intersection of architecture and urban design, and latest developments in material science happening on UCSD campus. 

In collaboration with CRM (Center for Renewable materials) Yoldas lab has been developing a multitude of applications from carbon capturing playgrounds for children to public art that slowly biodegrades into disappearance. 

This installation showcase actual elements from algae research such as a bio-degradation matrix with design proposals and speculative scenarios.
