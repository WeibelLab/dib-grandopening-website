A project of the UC San Diego Getty Pacific Standard Time Ocean Art + Science initiative, Ocean Prototypes brings together Native, Indigenous, and oceanographic ocean vessel design in workshops, design documentation, and an evening livestream panel to highlight resilience and diversity in Pacific coastal and island maritime design. 

The hand-crafted canoe is taken up in its multiple forms as a vehicle of cultural conservation and computation, with traditional Kumeyaay and CHamoru as well as experimental and culturally hybrid designs. Participants are from UC San Diego Visual Arts, Birch Aquarium, and the Design Lab, and Kosay Kumeyaay Market, Che'lu, the San Diego School of Creative and Performing Arts, and UC Irvine. Livestream event from 7-9 at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GRonqNjtX8.
