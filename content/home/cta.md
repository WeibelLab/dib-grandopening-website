### ABOUT THE DESIGN & INNOVATION BUILDING
The 74,000-square-foot Design and Innovation Building is a collaborative facility that aims to encourage new ideas, products and services from students, faculty, alumni and industry partners. Specifically, the goal is to encourage more collaboration between Jacobs School of Engineering, Visual Arts, Cognitive Science, the Design Lab, Office of Innovation and Commercialization, Alumni Association, among other campus departments.

The building will be steps away from the new Pepper Canyon Station of the UC San Diego Blue Line Trolley extension. The Design and Innovation Building and adjacent new amphitheater, as well as the forthcoming Pepper Canyon West housing project, will showcase the dynamic, creative energy of UC San Diego.
