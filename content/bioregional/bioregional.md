The Bioregional Center for Sustainability Science, Planning and Design (BioREG) creates community-university partnerships dedicated to team-based, problem-solving, and solutions-oriented action research. 

We seek ways to better understand and improve the coupling of  human and natural systems in the planning, design and lifespace development of neighborhoods, cities, towns, working landscapes, and coastal zones.

BioREG strives to bring diverse and equitable participation into solving complex socio-ecological, cultural and land management problems at the intersection of climate disruption, ecosystem degradation, infrastructure failure, and widening disparities in health and wellbeing, especially in communities of color. 

We are collectively reimagining ecological planning and democracy to inspire development that is regenerative, resilient, and just in our shared binational San Diego-Tijuana City-Region.
