This poster offers a description of a new Podcast series "Whose City? Whose Bioregion?: Design Innovations in the Cross-Border Region".

It briefly states why the Podcast will be timely, then goes on to preview topics that will be covered in future Podcasts, within three areas of concern:  Infrastructure/planning; Ecology & healthy placemaking;  Art/culture/design.
