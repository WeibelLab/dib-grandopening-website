The Global Action Research Center is a social change organization that works to connect grassroots organizing to policy makers and researchers by helping people find their voices in the decision-making and dialogue around their communities.

The Global ARC is guided by a philosophy dedicated to eradicating root causes of poverty, social injustice and environmental degradation. At the heart of this philosophy is a proactively creative commitment to linking knowledge to action for the common good. 

We promote research and action focused on community-building and sustainability solutions, and we work to ensure that such solutions are networked, systems-oriented, globally-minded, and ecologically-sound.
