The Community Engagement Studio is a space to conduct community-engaged work across UCSD, San Diego, and beyond. 

This space supports a variety of needs and topic areas where co-creation, design thinking, and community-driven work happen. 

This ranges from building relationships with industry, civic, and education partners; cultivating community-driven innovation ecosystems; creating and studying socio-technical architectures that support design thinking; conducting needs assessments, participatory design, and evaluation research; facilitating real-world learning and applications; developing partnerships for research and infrastructure; and building networks across the San Diego community
