The Speculative Ecology and Bioarchitecture space has a strong connection to the natural world and produces solutions for environmental justice. 

By offering a critical yet optimistic take on what our collective future holds, we strive to organically become a locus of inclusion for a lot of humans regardless of their background, gender and ethnicity. 

The  emphasis is on understanding ecology and biology from a new angle by augmenting a culture of openness and sharing. For students, staff and faculty the project space is permeable, in that, any member of the Design Lab can enter, ask questions and join the activities.
