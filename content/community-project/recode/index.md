What are steps we can take to shift the mindset from viewing research participants as "participants" toward working with them as research partners?  

The purpose of ReCODE Health is to elevate actions that inspire and promote ethical digital health research.  ReCODE Health is a resource for technologists, researchers, ethicists, regulators, institutions and participants involved in the digital health research process. 

Our value proposition is to increase awareness of ethical principles and practices from the earliest stages of technology design to the deployment of digital health research.
