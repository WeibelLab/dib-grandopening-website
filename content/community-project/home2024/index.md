San Diego-Tijuana is mobilizing design to transform our region: the initiative engages 7.1 million inhabitants across and at the border to design for innovation, transformation, activation and imagination. 
We are two countries and two cities, but one region and community continuously redefining and redesigning our cross-border home.

For San Diego-Tijuana, the impact of the World Design Capital initiative goes far beyond a series of events. It has the power to catalyze and transform life in the region through design excellence. 

The yearlong celebration will be a platform to fundamentally strengthen design values in our region through region-wide collaborative projects that will extend past the 2024 designation, while spotlighting our role as a global leader in transborder design.
