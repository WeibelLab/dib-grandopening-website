GradWIC is dedicated to fostering diversity and inclusion in the Computer Science and general STEM fields at UCSD.

Our goal is to ensure our colleagues have a strong support system and appropriate resources to pursue their endeavors. We are also committed to creating a comfortable environment and fun social group for our members. Work hard, play hard!

Our booth informs students about GradWIC and all that we do: community building, outreach, professional development, mentorship
