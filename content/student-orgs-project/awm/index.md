The Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) is a professional society whose mission is to encourage women and girls to study and have active careers in the mathematical sciences and to promote equal opportunity for and the equal treatment of women and girls in mathematics.

Visitors can come up to the table and choose one of our items: a wooden egg, a pencil, etc. 

They can then use a 3D graphing program to attempt to design something that would hold (contain) that object. The harder the item, the more points it gets. Additionally the player gets more points the closer their design is to the shape. For example, a cube can hold an egg, but an egg carton would earn more points because it is a closer fit.
