We are the Association for Computing Machinery at UCSD! We are an inclusive member-first community for all who are interested in the field of computing. We welcome all skill levels and majors!

ACM at UCSD has had over 30 project teams in the past year and a half! 

We have created projects ranging from internal tooling like our membership portal to an AI project around blending two images! 

These projects are intended to be interactive and showcase the work of many undergraduate designers and developers. Students and staff can walk up to these array of different projects and ask them about what they used to make it and play around with it.
