The DigiHealth Lab is developing a suite of health monitoring solutions with the programmable sensors of smartphones at the core. 

By leveraging the sensors in everyday smartphones, we are able to measure a range of vitals from hemoglobin, blood pressure, eye information, and much more. 

These smartphone measurements, combined with clinically derived algorithms, provide digital biomarkers that can deliver deeper insights into our daily health and wellness, and even help screen for early signs of dementia.
