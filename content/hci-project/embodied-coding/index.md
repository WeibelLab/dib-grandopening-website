This project creates an environment in which students can practice pair programming in an AR environment. 
Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation, on the same piece of code. 

Wearing AR headsets, students manipulate code in three-dimensional space, using familiar gestures such as pointing and grabbing. The use of an AR programming environment that immerses students in their code, forms a more intuitive and collaborative computing experience that engages learners with low confidence in programming, while supporting growth in their computational thinking abilities.
