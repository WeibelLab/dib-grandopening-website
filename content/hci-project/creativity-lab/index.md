The Creativity Lab aims to augment human creativity and productivity by bridging human cognition and digital computation. 

We develop dynamic and flexible representations of user interfaces as well as fluid and expressive interaction techniques with a variety of modalities, such as gestural interfaces, natural language input, and augmented/virtual reality.
