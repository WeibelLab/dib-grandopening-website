eXtended Reality (XR) has been growing in popularity as a collaboration medium, especially for remote guidance over physical tasks - where at least one person manipulates objects in their environment. This project aims to explore how to design XR-mediated remote collaboration systems that exploit the strengths of spatial computing.

Our research is relies on an in-depth understanding of both human communication patterns and the unique affordances of the technology. This allows us to create new new interaction techniques and alternate representations that could go beyond acheiving realism while making collaboration easier.
