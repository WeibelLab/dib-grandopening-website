The DigiHealth Lab is a research laboratory that is a joint effort between the UCSD Jacobs School for Engineering and The Design Lab. 

Led by PI Professor Edward J. Wang, the DigiHealth Lab researchers works towards bring health monitoring beyond the clinic by leveraging data-driven, digital technologies to create and enhance a new infrastructure for healthcare solutions. 

Innovations range from developing smartphone apps that can screen for Alzheimer's Disease to machine learning algorithms that can detect COVID cases.
