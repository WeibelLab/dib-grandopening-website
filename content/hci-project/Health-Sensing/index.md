Consumer wearable technology like the smartwatch, health trackers, sensorized garments, and even smart rings are bringing health and medical monitoring to the masses. 

The DigiHealth Lab is developing novel machine learning algorithms and user interactions with wearable health sensor data to enable new ways to understand health information measured by wearable sensors from use cases like early detection of upper respiratory infections to helping mothers assess breastfeeding quality.
