The Human-centered eXtended Intelligence Research Lab at UC San Diego focuses on the design, development, and evaluation of interactive technology. 

Our research work spans from Ubiquitous Computing, to Artificial Intelligence (AI), eXtended Reality (XR), and Immersive Visualization. nvestigates, designs, and develops new tools, techniques, and infrastructure to leverage the power of multimodal pervasive sensing and immersive visualization. 

We strive to first capture, quantify and understand human behavior, and then support better interaction with digital information. Our approach allows us to design and develop human-centered technology that extends human powers and intelligence beyond their current capacity.
