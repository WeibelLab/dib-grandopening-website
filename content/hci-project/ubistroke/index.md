The UbiStroke team is developing machine learning-based techniques to reliably identify and quantify stroke-related deficits such as weakness, facial droop, and speech slurring from video and audio. We are deploying and evaluating UbiStroke in the clinical setting to assist in the diagnosis of acute stroke.

HoloStroke is a spin-off of the UbiStroke project focusing on using mixed reality to support stroke diagnosis through remote holographic visits with a neurologist specialized in stroke.
